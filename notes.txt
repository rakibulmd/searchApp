Steps:


1. Create a React project. (Create react app with vite).
2. Create a home page.
3. Create a input field to take the search input. We need to use a react state to store the input field data.
4. Add two button to select the search engine. One for wikipedia, one for stack overflow. We need another state to store which search engine is active.
5. Add a submit button. 

//
After pressing the submit button, we will call the fetch function to fetch data either from stack overflow or wikipedia. 
We have two different function to fetch data. 
We have two different component to show the data.
